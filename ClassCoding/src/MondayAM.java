    Write a program that asks users to type letters (one letter at a
    time) and ends when the user types a number. When the user types
    a number, the program reports the two "largest" letters. Size is
    defined by the position of the letter in the alphabet. We assume
    that only lower case letters are entered. Smallest letter is 'a'
    and largest letter  is  'z'.  Your code  must have  at least two
    methods (including main).
